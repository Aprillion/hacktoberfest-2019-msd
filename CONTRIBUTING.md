Keep in mind while creating commits:

- use common sense
- keep the scope of commit small (don't mix fixes, features in one
  commit)
- write meaningful commit messages, see
  [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- if you like emojis, use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/)
